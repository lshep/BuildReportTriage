You have been warned multiple times.  We are proceeding with deprecation of your
package.  The package will remain deprecated until the package is fixed to build
and check cleanly on the Bioconductor builders AND you formally request
undeprecation at bioc-devel@bioconductor.org.
If the package remains deprecated, at the time of the next release (normally
April/May or Oct/Nov) the package will be removed from Bioconductor and the
package will have to be resubmitted and undergo review to be reinstated.
