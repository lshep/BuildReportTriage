Hello Package Maintainer,

The Bioconductor Team would like to notify you that your package is currently
failing on the devel version of Bioconductor, and has been for an extended
period of time.  Please fix your package to R CMD build and R CMD check cleanly
immediately to avoid deprecation of your package. While devel is a place to
experiment with new features, we expect packages to build and check cleanly in a
reasonable time period and not stay broken for any extended period of time. If
you are having trouble or have any further questions please do not hesitate to
reach out to the developers mailing list at bioc-devel@r-project.org

We appreciate your attention to this matter. 

Cheers
