We understand that your package is failing because dependency package
xxx is not available. xxx was removed from CRAN on xx-xx-xxxx. (optionally
include link to CRAN removal page)

We only allow dependencies that are actively on CRAN or Bioconductor. We
encourage you to reach out to the maintainer of the CRAN package to see if it
will or can be reinstated but otherwise you will need to alter your package to
longer list the package as a dependency.

Your package is at risk for deprecation if it remains broken. Don't hesitate to ask on the bioc-devel mailing list if you have any question or need help.


Thank you for your time and effort. We appreicate your quick attention to this matter.
