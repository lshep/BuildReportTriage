We would like to bring to your attention that your package is failing to build
or check on our release and devel build machines:

Devel:
bioconductor.org/checkResults/devel/bioc-LATEST/

Release:
bioconductor.org/checkResults/release/bioc-LATEST/

Would you mind taking a look at this? Don't hesitate to ask on the bioc-devel mailing list if you have any question or need help.

This is very problematic.   If no action is taken over the next few weeks we
 will begin the deprecation process for your package.

Thank you for your time and effort. We appreicate your quick attention to this matter.
