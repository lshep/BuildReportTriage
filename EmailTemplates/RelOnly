Hello,

We would like to inform you that your package is failing on the release version of Bioconductor.  

bioconductor.org/checkResults/release/bioc-LATEST/

This ERROR does not occur in the devel version of Bioconductor.  Perhaps you fixed a bug and pushed changes only to the git.bioconductor.org master branch?  Please remember to also push bug corrections to RELEASE_X_Y branch.
