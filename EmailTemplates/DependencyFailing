We understand that your package is failing because dependency package
xxx is not available.  We have tried to reach out to the maintainer of package
xxx who has currently been unresponsive or has not fixed their package. If their
package remains broken, your package is also at risk for deprecation.  We
encourage you to reach out to the maintainer of xxx to encourage a prompt bug
fix or to start adapting your package to not utilize the functionality of xxx in
preparation for it being removed and to avoid deprecation of your package.

Don't hesitate to ask on the bioc-devel mailing list if you have any question or need help.

Thank you for your time and effort. We appreicate your quick attention to this matter.
